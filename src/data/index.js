		My background in Data Science and Machine Learning allows me to design not only responsive and interactive interfaces but also intelligent applications that deliver data-driven insights in real time.\
		I enjoy building products where data meets design from dashboards that visualize predictive analytics to interfaces that interact seamlessly with AI-powered APIs. With hands-on experience in Python, \
		Scikit-learn, Flask, and RESTful API integration, I bridge frontend engineering with backend intelligence, creating smart, efficient, and human-centered digital solutions.\
		I’m committed to continuous learning, exploring emerging technologies like LLMs, data visualization, and AI-assisted UX, and collaborating with teams to push the boundaries \
		of what’s possible on the web."
